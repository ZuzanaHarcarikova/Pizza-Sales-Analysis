### Hi there 👋 I'm Zuzana!

I'm a data enthusiast with a background in audit and financial analysis.  
Currently pivoting into **data analytics**, focusing on:

- **SQL** (querying, transformations, reporting)
- **Power BI** (interactive dashboards, DAX, data modeling)
- **Python** (pandas, data cleaning, exploratory analysis)

💡 I enjoy working with data to extract insights, automate manual reporting, and solve real-world problems.

🛠️ On this profile, you’ll find:
- Projects showcasing my **SQL and Power BI** skills
- End-to-end data workflows (from raw data to dashboard)
- Exploratory analysis in Python

📚 I have academic SQL background and hands-on experience analyzing databases during my time as an auditor.

📍 Currently open to junior data analyst roles.

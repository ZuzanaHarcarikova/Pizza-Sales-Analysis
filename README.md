# Pizza-Sales-Analysis
Pizza restaurant analysis using Python + SQL + Power BI


This project is here to show that:

1. I can write SQL queries that make sense and answer real questions,

2. I understand the data well enough to turn it into a clear visual story,

3. And I can use Python when executing Exploratory Data Analysis

1. Overview Dashboard

3. Dataset

I have downloaded the dataset from the platform Kaggle. This dataset contains detailed information about pizza orders, including specifics about the pizza variants, quantities, pricing, dates, times, and categorization details.

5. Python EDA

I have performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python.
  1. I have quickly verified the structure of the data to analyze.
  2. I have identified data types and chosed appropriate analysis methods.
  3. I have determine whether I need to handle NULL values. No NULL values were found.
  4. I have determined wheter I need to perform type conversions. As there are date formats with datatype OBJECT, conversion will be necessary.
  5. I replaced the values in the size column from short codes s, m, and l to their full forms: Small, Medium, and Large. This step will ensure clarity and readability, better presentation      in reports and charts, improved interpretability for others and consistency across the project.
  6. The output from Python is a CSV file, cleaned_pizza_sales.csv. I will utilize this cleaned dataset to load into Power BI for creating an interactive dashboard.


6. SQL
I used SQL queries on the cleaned_pizza_sales table within the pizza_project database to perform a comprehensive analysis.

The queries cover:

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
Calculated total revenues, total pizzas sold, and total number of unique orders to get an overall snapshot of sales performance.

Trend Analysis:
Analyzed revenue trends by month, day of the week, and hour of the day to identify patterns in customer purchasing behavior over time.

Categorical Analysis:
Summarized revenue by pizza category and size, showing each categoryâ€™s contribution to total sales for a better understanding of popular products.

Descriptive Statistics:
Computed average quantities sold per order, average revenue per order, and average daily revenue to understand typical sales metrics.

Top and Bottom Products:
Identified top 5 and bottom 5 pizzas by revenue, as well as top 5 pizzas by quantity sold, to highlight the best and worst performing items.

These queries provided me with detailed insights into sales performance, customer behavior trends, and product popularity, supporting data-driven decision-making for the pizza restaurant.
